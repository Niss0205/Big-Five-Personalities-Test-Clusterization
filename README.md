# Big-Five-Personalities-Test-Clusterization

Recently  I’ve been quite interested in psychology and since I’m into data science, I thought it would be a great opportunity to tackle this topic.
I worked with unsupervised learning for the first time with this project. I used K-Means model to find the clusters using some powerful visualization library.

### The Dataset
